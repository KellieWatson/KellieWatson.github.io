In December 2015 I completed a Bachelor of Science in Computer Systems, Embedded Systems, at the Arizona State University, a division of the IRA A. Fulton Schools of Engineering. During the course of my education I developed a solid foundational understanding of computer systems and the networks they create. My studies include operating system development, low level logic and design, networking, distributed systems, and programming languages such as Java, C, C++, MASM, XML, and SQL. Additionally I have gained experience with configuring limited resource devices such as Arduino Microcontrollers and Raspberry Pi computer systems. Studying computers at these varied levels of abstraction has provided me the ability to move with ease and adapt to new systems and languages, each with nuances which require unique considerations. Moreover multiple perspectives has allowed me to more effectively and efficiently leverage these systems to solve societal and business concerns."}),Object(l.jsx)("p",{children:"In addition to my studies at Arizona State University I have been working as a fiduciary assistant. Over the past several years I have been exposed to most all aspects of small business. I have developed a more thorough understanding of finance, the impact of economic conditions, and the entrepreneurial aspects of corporate life. Employment as a fiduciary assistant has been a highly beneficial venture. My experience in the customer service industry has been extensive. In the past fifteen years I have worked at The Chart House in La Jolla, in the office of Richard Baddour M.D., Lotsa Pasta, and with the Western Athletic Clubs. In all these jobs personability and communication skills were essential: two of the traits that made me excel in each setting. At the Chart House I was promoted three times in three years and acknowledged at a yearly employee meeting for outstanding customer service. At Lotsa Pasta my positive attitude and friendly yet professional demeanor was quickly rewarded with the promotion to waitress.
